Task 1
    
    Function: This is a simple Python program that takes a number from the user and calculates its factorial.

    Working:
        1. Prompts the user to enter a number.
        2. Converts the input to an integer.
        3. Checks if the number is positive:
            - If yes, calculation of factorial is done.
            - If not, it tells the user that its factorial is undefined.
        4. A recursive function is defined that returns 'n * factorial(n - 1)'.
        5. Finally the result is printed.

Task 2

    Function: This is a simple python code that performs Calculations Using the Math Module.

    Worrking:
        1. Imports the math module.
        2. Uses If Elif Else for error handling.
        3. Calculates square root, logarithm and sine.
        4. Finally the result is printed.
